## Why not use Word or Google Docs?
* Easier - Never take your fingers off the keyboard
* Focus on content, not layout
* Better integration with code or charts
* Push it to and edit on GitHub
* Free, open-source, anyone can use and edit without proprietary software
* Easily export to pdf, html, etc.

## What's a markup language?

--
**From Wikipedia**:
> A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.[1] The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts, i.e., the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.

Like HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)!

### Web and General Text Editing
* http://dillinger.io/
* https://stackedit.io/editor

**Don't forget!** You can always use your favorite text editor! I use [Atom](https://atom.io/), but [Sublime Text](sublime text) supports Markdown too. Emacs has out of the box LaTeX integration.

There are lots of paid ones too, but why use those when you can use **free** and **open-source**?
